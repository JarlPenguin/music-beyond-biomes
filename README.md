# Rebalanced Music
Tweaked version of [Balanced Music](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/balanced-music). Older tracks now have an equal chance of playing compared to newer tracks (where applicable).

Yeets the non-menu music from the menu, and balances the weight of newer music. The new music is great, but it plays instead of the old tracks far too often. Seriously, why does So Below have a weight of 7?
### Important:

If you have other resource packs that change music or sounds, put them above this. This pack uses the `replace` option to remove music, and will remove any music added if placed above that pack.
